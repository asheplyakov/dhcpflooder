dhcpflooder is a weird DHCP client which asks for IP using a fake MAC address,
and releases it after a short (possibly zero) period of time.
Useful for testing if DHCP server operates properly under a load.

Prerequisites: python 2.7, python-scapy

Suggested usage:

1. Configure and start the DHCP server.
2. Start capturing DHCP traffic:

   sudo tcpdump -i $IFACE -w dhcp.pcap 'udp and (port 67 or port 68)'

3. Start dhcpflooder:

   IFACE=eth0
   for mac in mac1 mac2 mac3 mac4; do
   	sudo ./dhcpflooder.py -i $IFACE $mac
   done
